		<h1>The Game</h1>
<h3 style="padding-bottom: 0px">Welcome to Samurai Champloo, set in the Tokugawa Era, a period between 1603 and 1868 in Japan. Join the three main characters as they attempt to survive while inadvertently save a village.</h3>

<h3>Your goal is to defeat Rikiei, a gang leader that’s terrorizing the town of Takahata. To challenge him to an honourable duel, you must find and give him a valuable item at the doors of his headquarters. Regulars at the town tell you to head to gambling house for quick cash, but others warn you; it’s just a trap for foreigners. You have $1000 on hand but need more to acquire something substantial. Conflicted, you ponder your options while standing in the middle of the town. Time is ticking.</h3>
